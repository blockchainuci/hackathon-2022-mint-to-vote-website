# Main website for Hackathon 2022 mint to vote

Utilizing the Harmony Chain we created a fully decentralized trustless system that utilizes NFTs on the Harmony Chain to cast a vote in a decentralized environment.

In our sample video, there are two candidates running against each other. A user can connect their wallet to cast a vote towards whichever nominee they would like to vote for. An NFT designated to the nominee is then minted representing a singular vote for the candidate. Using on chain explorers, the general public can view how many votes each candidate received to verify that elections were not miscounted or fraudulent.

Future scalability would include the involvement of Blockpass, an on chain KYC solution. Users would KYC through Blockpass and enter their wallet address. Upon successful verification, Blockpass would send users a token which the smart contract would check to see if it exists and allow minting access. As gas fees are virtually nonexistent, they could also be subsidized by the governing party to provide a truly free voting experience.

Utilizing Harmony's Blockchain, voting can be done in a truly trustless environment ensuring the extinction of fraudulent elections.
